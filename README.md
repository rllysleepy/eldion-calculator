# eldion-calculator
A very, very unoptimized calculator for Eldion written in PyQt5.
Honestly, I don't even know how to use Github.. please send help.

Anyways, this should run most optimally on 1920 x 1080 displays, but idk...
You can either choose to run the exe, or run it in your IDE:
- if you choose to run the exe, just click confirm on the Windows Security warning--IDK why Windows doesn't recognize executables build from Python
- if you run it in your IDE, make sure you have PyQt5 installed or it won't work lmao (`python -m pip install PyQt5`)
