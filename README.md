# eldion-calculator
A very, very unoptimized calculator for Eldion written in PyQt5.

Anyways, this should run most optimally on 1920 x 1080 displays, but idk...
You can either choose to run the exe, or run it in your IDE:
- if you choose to run the exe, just click confirm on the Windows Security warning--why Windows doesn't recognize executables build from Python
- if you run it in your IDE, make sure you have PyQt5 installed or it won't work lmao (`python -m pip install PyQt5`)

Again, IMPORTANTLY:
- IGNORE THE WINDOWS SECURITY WARNING. All Python files compiled into an executable WILL be flagged as a virus, as it doesn't have a Windows signature
- You can scan it with virustotal, but I promise it is safe.

Cheers, have fun, report any bugs in the Issues tab.
